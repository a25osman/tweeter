# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a 1-page AJAX-based Twitter clone, built using jQuery, HTML5 and CSS. Use it to share anything you want to tweet about, just make sure to keep it under 140 characters. Don't worry though, if it gets too long or nothing is there, Tweeter has a handy message to let you know whats wrong.
